Phase 1: Basic Simulation Setup
Servers: Simulate servers using objects or lightweight processes. Each has:

Location (region)

Latency (simulated value)

CPU load (%)

Packet loss rate

Jitter (variance in response latency)

Current number of requests

Client requests: A request is just a demand for a file (e.g., index.html).

➡️ Implementation:
We’ll make a Server class in Python with these metrics, and a SmartRouter class that queries all servers and picks the optimal one.
