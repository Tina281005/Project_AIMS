Load the CSV data (server_metrics_week.csv)

Prepare features (input data) and the target (what you want to predict, e.g., future CPU load)

Train a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict next-minute CPU load per server

Evaluate model performance

Save the trained model (for router integration in the next step)
